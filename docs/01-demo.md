# Demo (Inkwell)

To showcase the capabilities of Elemental, a fully working platform called **[Inkwell](https://inkwell.anees.dev)** has been developed using Elemental. Inkwell is a unique space dedicated to the pure essence of storytelling. In line with Elemental's goal of having no external dependencies, Inkwell has been crafted using plain HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP only.

## Why Choose Elemental?

Elemental has been designed with the aim of having no strings attached. There are no dependencies on external libraries or frameworks. The aim is to give the developers a genuine sense of controlâ€”an open door to independently explore and understand the magical stuff that powers the framework.

The overarching goal? Let developers fully embrace and leverage the elegance of powerful abstractions like DI containers, ORMs, Middlewares, and more. But here's the kickerâ€”Elemental is not just pointing the way. It is handing you the keys to unravel the mysteries, empowering you to explore how these abstractions are laid out in the code.

In fact, you are encouraged not just to follow the path but to venture off the beaten track. Dive into the codebase, dissect the abstractions, and understand their inner workings. Feel free to tweak and experiment, for Elemental is not just a frameworkâ€”it's an open invitation to shape and mold the tools at your disposal. Because coding shouldn't be a maze; it should be a journey. Let's make that journey together. ðŸš€
